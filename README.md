# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project has a screen of bouncing balls, and in the middle is an evil circl where if a ball hits the evil circle it will disappear

## Sources and Credits

I used some copilot for helping me with the bouncing balls counter It was manily this code here 
'
const para = document.querySelector("p");
let ballCount = 0;
function updateCount() {
  if (para) para.textContent = `Ball count: ${ballCount}`;
}
'

I have never really done that before, If i could have done it a different way i totally would But i just did what was in the instructions. 

In order to run this project just use the live server and watch the magic happen.
